        <p>TDT4140 is a project based subject in Computer Science 2nd grade at NTNU. We where devided into
        pseudorandom groups based on computing skills. We were informed that we would make a PekkaBot and,
            we would get more information later.

        Despite of technological advancements made in the past 50 years, the university education has been
        quite stable for hundreds of years with its frontal lectures, exercises, assignments and grading.
        We believe that it is time to change this! With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence and Big
        Data, automation will be a more visible part of our life in the near future. Did you know that 90%
        of the worldâ€™s data was created in the last two years? With our solution, we will bring forward the
        biggest change in university education since the introduction of computers. This assignment is the
        kick-off for the TDT4140 project.</p>
        <p><a class="sectionOverhead">Project description<br></a>
        We where asked to interview a couple of lecturers and/or professors. Either at IDI, NTNU or outside
            to find a problem to fix. We would ask the lecturer/professors about their top-5 problems they are
            currently facing in their teacher endeavors. In particular we where interested in problems that
            could be automated.
            <br><br>
            The project assignment was: <br> <!--TODO(assignmentInfo): add some general information about the assignment-->
        The project group consists of three computer science students; Morten Mulvik, Kjetil Vaagen and Martin Halvor
        Kostveit and one computer engineering student; Mathias . </p>
